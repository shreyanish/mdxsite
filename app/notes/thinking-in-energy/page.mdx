# Thinking in Energy

We're constantly cycling energy -- outlets so many you spend joules choosing one and inlets only many you budget some to get back to. Our bodies understand how vital this concept is to the extent that each of its cells are programmed to manage this currency. A concept that is closely tied to its sole purpose -- survival.

Being a cycle, it stays true to its definition -- ending the loop seeking for the same inlet it started at. It's easy to visualise the concept working on physical aspects -- consuming food to keep the body moving being the most obvious, but it's surprising how widely unconscious we are with choices while the mind works on the same idea. 

It becomes important to understand because what decides the outlets afterall is the mind. What commanded neanderthals to go hunt down animals in the jungle is what is asking you to run your fingers up a plastic brick -- a well-engineered mirage that illudes you to feel good while you're draining, for just another five minutes. But why?

Humans have limitless freedom and are ever more capable of pursuing a purpose beyond their self. To give in and let the mind run in loops you never gave enough thought about, gradually pulls you down to the median. You are running in circles that was put out by someone already, comforted by others around and forget yourself while your energy is being sucked.

Someone that finds joy wheezing through with burning calves will anyday choose a track with a bigger radii than the one that just wants to finish two laps. What makes him live through each of his strides is him choosing a circle that constantly puts him in a higher internal state. To live through the act becoming the inlet to pursue things bigger than oneself.

To think in energy has been finding a maximising function. To nail down on one or two that lets me afford showing up to bigger ones and available for important ones while removing variables that'd been set to default. Seems like a never ending iterative process, and that's one loop I'm happy I found myself in.
