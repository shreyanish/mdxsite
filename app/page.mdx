I believe every experience is centred around people and time, while one’s will to think through physics and decipher art majorly influences their interpretation.

I'm currently studying computer science and economics at BITS Pilani.

## Previously

I’ve help build autonomous ai agents that act on natural language commands at [Adopt](#), a decentralised cryptocurrency exchange at [Eddy Finance](#), and an early stage startup accelerator at [Conquest](#). I've included more details in [/work](/work).

## Links

I sporadically post unfiltered thoughts I find interesting on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/fluxonr). Thoughts I chew onto more than I should turn into notes in [/notes](/notes). 

You can find a clearer picture of me on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shreyanish).
