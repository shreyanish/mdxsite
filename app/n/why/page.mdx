This site is a constant effort to articulate thoughts - those that silence the rest, those thinking twice doesn't suffice for, and those that conclude to altering perspectives or branch progressively into more developed thoughts.

To articulate these thoughts here is to find someone that tripped off urls to share with the same, hear a different conclusion or receive intellectual criticism from. If you reading this is that someone, please reach out to me on x/twitter.

Here's a [gift](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7CKHKCVdfkkQbzUTFVLfoK?si=aHFK66diS9WzXg37dC36NQ) for halting on this url and choosing to spend time. Much love.
