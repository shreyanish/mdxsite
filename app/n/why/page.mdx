This site is a constant effort to articulate thoughts and ideas that silence all the other thousand running behind and conclude to altered perspectives or branch progressively into further developed ones. 

I am no expert. To articulate these thoughts here is to find someone that tripped off urls to share with and hear a uniquely different conclusion or receive intellectual criticism from. If you reading this is that someone, please reach out to me on x/twitter.

Here's a [gift](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7CKHKCVdfkkQbzUTFVLfoK?si=aHFK66diS9WzXg37dC36NQ) for halting and spending your time here. Much love.
