This site is a constant effort to articulate thoughts that silence all the other thousand and concludes to altered perspectives or branch progressively into more developed ones. 

I am no expert in any of these. To articulate these thoughts here is to find someone that tripped off urls to share with and hear a different opinion or receive intellectual criticism from. If you reading this is that someone, please reach out to me on x/twitter.

Here's [something](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7CKHKCVdfkkQbzUTFVLfoK?si=aHFK66diS9WzXg37dC36NQ) in return for halting and spending your time here. Much love.
