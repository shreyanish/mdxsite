## Adopt AI

<Small>Engineer, 2025</Small>

Adopt redefines how users interact with software using AI agents that perform tasks on natural language commands. Worked with [Anirudh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anirudh-badam/) to bring full autonomy in the agents. 

If you're a business that wants to catch up and enable your users with agents, get early access [here](https://adopt.ai).

## Eddy Finance

<Small>Developer, 2023 - 2024</Small>

Jumped on the oppurtunity barely knowing any React and went on to ship, working alongside [Abhishek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhishek-kumar-12a983155/), the client application for the testnet, mainnet and rebuilding it. It served 400K+ MAU and $100M+ in volume transacted. 

Eddy, simply put, helps users swap one crypto for another or the same crypto from
one network to another on Zetachain.

## Conquest, BITS Pilani

<Small>Lead, 2022 - 2024</Small>

An initiative born out of curiosity for mechanics of and desire to work closely with, the Indian startup ecosystem. Could easily throw a few big numbers and names, but the biggest takeaway was the influence [Karman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karman-sethi-163179217/) had on my writing, and the confidence I built talking to the biggest executives from India day in and day out for two months.

Conquest works exclusively with early stage startups - connecting them with leaders from the ecosystem and providing an equity-less cash grant. If you are a founder, do check it out [here](https://conquestbits.org).
